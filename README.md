Second homework for the Algorithms course. The task was to complete the bodies of the functions in the files hashtable.c, btree.c (iteratively),btree.c (recursively) and exa.c.

hashtable: table with dispersed entries<br>
btree/rec: binary search tree and operations on it implemented recursively<br>
btree/iter: binary search tree and operations on it implemented iteratively<br>
btree/exa: simple use and balancing of the binary search tree<br>
